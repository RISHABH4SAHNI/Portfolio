As digital banking expands, the volume and complexity of financial data have outpaced traditional rule-based systems. Our goal is to build an intelligent binary classification model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions, helping institutions prevent losses and maintain user trust. We worked with a widely used synthetic dataset containing millions of labeled transaction records. Our approach included careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and selecting encoding strategies based on data characteristics. We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to find the most effective solution.
